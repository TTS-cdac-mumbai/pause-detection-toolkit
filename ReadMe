Prerequisite
	Kaldi  (GPU-preferred)
	Unified Parser / Parser

Input:
	Put txt.done.data file in input/ directory
	Put respective wav files in input/wav directory 

Setup:
	Change path.sh according to kaldi setup
	update the unified parser path in : scripts_alignment_for_TTS/text_lexicon.pl
	change path of kaldi variable in path.sh
	change path of "basepath" variable in resources/text-correction/path.properties


Run command:

	 bash run.sh DataPath  NumberofJobs BoundaryCorrectionflag SamplingRate
eg:      bash run.sh /home/HindiMale/  16 1 16000


The  DataPath (/home/HindiMale/) folder should have:
	wav folder # with all the wav files  use 16KHz files
	txt.done.data file  # with corresponding text
	hybrid folder with  output_lab_phone, output_lab_syllable folders from hybrid segmentation ### run hybrid segmentation once to get these folders

	Or modify these paths in run.sh
		WAVPath=$DataPath/wav/ 
		TXT=$DataPath/txt.done.data 
		HybDatapath=$DataPath/hybrid/

Adjust the following flag in run.sh accordingly for DNN or CNN training: 
	DNN=1
	CNN=1 
	iterations=8   # for number of DNN iterations
	BC=1   # for boundary correction, set it to 1


Run Command-

goto-resources/text-correction/

and- 

sh runJava.sh
